Any script designed to appear to damage a machine or actually and intentionally damage a machine will result in consequences.

The motto is do NO actual harm. And make sure you tell your 'victim' how to return to a working a machine.

batch file codes for the system backup

/s copies system files
/c carries out the command specified by the string, then terminates
/d enables drive and directory changes
/e copies empty directories
/h copies hidden files
/i if destination doesn't exist, and you're copying more than one file, /i assumes the destination must be a directory
